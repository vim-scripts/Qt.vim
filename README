only for unix/linux

Anyone who uses Trolltech's fabulous Toolkit Qt is able to generate cpp/h files using the xml Files generated by the Qt-Desginer. 
By using an additional inheriting instance your can make your layout code ( the ui/cpp/h files in the basedir) independant from your implementation code ( the classImpl.ccp and classImpl.h in your pwd).
Thats what this little script does.
Additionally it makes a pro-file for qmake.
The plugin appears in your menubar as Plugin/QT

- create a new dir
- start your editor : gvim myfile.ui
- Plugin/QT/UIC subImpl -> creates a base directory with .cpp/.h/.ui file -> a subdeclaration with the .cpp/.h files -> main.ccp and a pro-file. If your want it will run qmake, make and executes the resulting program.

- Plugin/QT/UIC Impl creates only the .cpp und .h from your .ui file

- Manpageview for qt classes: type for example :Man QString and see how it works. You can also type K when your coursor is over a qt class name.

Suggestions are welcome.
